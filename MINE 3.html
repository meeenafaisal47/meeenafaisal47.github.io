<h1><center>duties of prime minister</center></h1>
<p>Under departmental statutes, it is the presiding Minister who is vested with powers, duties and functions. Many of the Ministers’ powers are normally exercised on the Ministers’ behalf by deputy ministers and departmental officials, who may in some cases act under formal delegations. Ministers are individually accountable to Parliament and the Prime Minister for their own actions and those of their department, including the actions of all officials under their management and direction.
Ministers’ portfolio responsibilities may include a variety of arm’s-length organizations, such as agencies, tribunals and Crown corporations. In the case of such organizations, the enabling legislation may vest powers, duties and functions directly in a deputy head or in a body such as a board or commission, although the Minister will in most cases have residual powers, duties and functions. Ministers’ relationships with these organizations must respect the parameters of their legal authorities. A discussion of Ministers’ roles with respect to such bodies is found in Annex H, “Portfolio Organizations.”
The Prime Minister may assign additional responsibilities to a Minister, either through an Order in Council[3] or as a result of a designation by the Prime Minister. Consequently, ministerial responsibilities can encompass a range of diverse activities, some based on statute, others on specific direction provided by the Prime Minister.<hr>
