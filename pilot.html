<h1>life of a pilot</h1>
Pilots are responsible for many time-consuming duties before and after a flight, including weather assessments, filing flight plans, performing pre-flight checks on aircraft and filing post-flight reports, to ensure each flight is operated to the highest level of safety.

The pilot's responsibilities include transporting passengers and cargo, determining the safest routes, analyzing flight plans and weather conditions, calculating fuel, and inspecting operation systems and navigation equipment.
