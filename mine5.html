  <h2>study about subjects</h2>
<marquee>Some of the most common subjects at school are Language arts, history, mathematics, physical education and science.
The subject of study is the topic that is being investigated, while the object of study is the specific thing that is being observed or analyzed. For example, in a study of the effects of climate change on plant growth, the subject of study would be climate change, while the object of study would be plant growth.</marquee>

<p>Zoology involves the study of animals. Not just any study, but how to classify animals, their history, their anatomy and physiology, their development, and so much more. Just like there are many components to zoology, there are many branches of zoology and tools zoologists use to do their job well.What is the importance of zoology Through the study of zoology, you can gain an understanding of the natural world and how we can help with conservation. It also offers the opportunity to consider ways to face global challenges such as climate change and food security, trying to find solutions to help both animals and humans alike.</div>
